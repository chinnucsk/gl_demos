A couple of opengl demos using wxErlang.

image - tests transfer of images between wx and opengl.

cubes - contains vertex shader animations and shadow mapping.

draw_wings_models - loads and displays wings models exported with the example
		  exporter.  Turn on the cool shader in options menu.
   

erl -make && erl -run <demomodule>

If you have something cool that you want me to include, send it to me.
